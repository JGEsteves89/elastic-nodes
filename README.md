# Elastic nodes

This is a simple proof of concept for a self-ordering node graph using physic elastic links and magnetic repulsion.

It all started with Factorio (the game), trying to conceptualize a non-intersecting factory of materials. It turns out you can, you have to be big enough and have 45 degrees belts.

On other hand, this simulation can be improved by trying to switch positions of every link that intersects until every link does not cross anymore. I think I heard some algorithm does the same thing, to unravel really long molecules in chemistry.
